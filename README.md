# CovidTracking
IDS HACKATHON

Django implementation

User need to login first to perform actions
Once logged in he/she can control profile at profile tab
If the user is doctor then he only can create a report.
Doctor and patient both can see report.
Report in form of graph.
Graph is implemented using Chart.js apis.
Toggle between data and graph type using buttons.
To toggle I have destroyed the chart obj first then added new chart element.
However,the prj is not still completed.UI needs to be completed.
Due to my own time constraints,I will be doing it later.
Thanks!!
